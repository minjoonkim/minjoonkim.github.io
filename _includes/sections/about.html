    I am a Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department of Seoul National University. My research interests lie in data collection and its applications. Currently, I am focusing on user preference data and its expressions. I am looking at discovering how user preference is infused in data, ways to collect user preferences, and applications utilizing such information. Aside from research, my hobbies include playing the piano and Ultimate. I play competitively, with experience as a member of the Korea national team for various Asia-Oceania and Worlds events.
