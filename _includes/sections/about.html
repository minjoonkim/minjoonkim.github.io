<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I am a Ph.D. student at the Seoul National University focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience. With a computer science background, I have studied a broad range of topics including computational biology, HCI, image processing, and computer vision. My current research interests lie in user preference data and its expressions. I am intrigued to find novel ways to collect user preferences, and to explore various ways to express preference (and other things) via data. I have a deep passion for sports and sports analytics. I also play competitive ultimate on the side.
