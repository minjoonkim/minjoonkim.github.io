<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I am a Ph.D. student at the Seoul National University focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience. With a computer science background, I have studied a broad range of topics including computational biology, HCI, image processing, and computer vision. My current research and interests lie in data-driven user research. I am intrigued to find novel ways to collect user behavior data, and to discover insightful meanings like quantitative satisfaction detection through quantitative user behavior analysis. Ultimately, I want to see how data can be used for the betterment of users, systems, and the digital environment. In addition to academics, I have a deep passion for sports, and in some ways sports analytics. I also play ultimate on the side ;)
