I will be doing this for each conference that I attend. It will be structured in (mostly) 3 parts: before the conference, during the conference (possibly more than one during-the-conference posting), and after the conference. I hope that I will get better at writing these and applying whatever I learn to my own studies and research! Here's the first one, CHI 2018.

*Writing from: Crew Collective & Cafe, a hip and bustling coffee house reincarnated from an old bank building.*
*Current Weather: Sunny, 13˚C*  
*Current mood: Tired. Sleepy... Jet-lag's got me pretty good*

## What do you hope to gain by attending this conference?
As this is my first CHI conference, I want to, first of all, get a taste of what HCI and UX researchers focus in this venue. I have submitted to CHI before and had my paper rejected. While I have read many CHI papers, I have a feeling that I still don't "get" the conference atmosphere yet. I believe actually attending the conference, and not just getting "the vibes" from accepted papers, would benefit me immensely. As a future-submitter, I hope that I would be able to find a good overlap between my research interests and the conference themes. I also want to find some tangible ideas and notions that I can directly implement into my studies. It can be in the form of seed papers that I can base my research off of, or it can be some methodology that I can use when conducting research. All in all, I am looking forward to attending my first CHI conference.

## Goals and Objectives
We're gonna start small here... Baby steps!

* Goal 1: Ask a question to presenters -- Get over my shyness, and ask questions to presenters.
* Goal 2: Network! Get to know at least one new person
* Goal 3: Get a takeaway. Find a cornerstone which I can build my research on.

This is going to be my first opportunity to branch outside of Korea in the field of HCI. The main "theme" here is to get over my shyness and actually engage in meaningful and critical conversations with my international colleagues. Getting valuable insight from other people, especially from different countries and cultures can provide a new perspective on seemingly mundane ideas. I hope to meet new people and get to know their interests, their research and see how they approach various problems. It may even become an opportunity to work with them in the future. In sum, I want to bring back with me something that I can use.
