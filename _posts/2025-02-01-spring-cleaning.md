It's been a while since the last blog post (as you can see in the recent news section), and since I've moved house and am starting fresh, I figured to do the same for my digital home. 

I'm still contemplating how to use this space, but I figured I need to write more. The goal (at first) is to post once a month. Then as I'm getting in the groove I'll move into posting more. 

Not sure what I'll be posting, but, at least I'm starting (again). 

Cheers,
