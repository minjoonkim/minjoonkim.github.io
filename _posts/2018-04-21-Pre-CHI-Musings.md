Here I am at Montréal, waiting for my first CHI experience. I am somewhat jet-lagged and have a headache from not drinking my morning coffee, but it is being cured as we speak! mmm ☕️ (flat whites are the best)

*Writing from: Starbucks right across from my Airbnb flat*  
*Weather: Sunny and Clear, 3˚C*  
*Current mood: Eh. Could be better (I have mixed feelings towards the flat). Excited. Relief (A good chunk of time for myself; the Montréal air is pretty damn nice — curse you, Seoul’s micro-dust pollution; A somewhat forced break from my work back home, but a break’s a break! Can’t be picky)*  

Things to do today — will come back to check my progress:
* Register (early) for CHI at the conference venue, Palais des Congrès ✅
* Find myself a pre-paid SIM ✅
* Buy a public transportation card (A thing I collect when traveling abroad) ✅
* Hit up Schwartz’s Deli
* Walk around! Wander ✅
* Try to speak some french? ✅
* Check out the apple store (eh, could do at a later time. low priority) ✅

-- 6 out of 7.

Anyways. CHI.
After receiving an email from my colleague about writing a “conference notebook”, I have decided to make one for my first-ever CHI. I will post my conference notebook as a separate post, and will post one for each day of the conference as well!
