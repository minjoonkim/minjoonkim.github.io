title: The "What has Minjoon done now" Blog
excerpt: "I think a found a use for this blog. I am going to write about how I messed up each day. I will add some things that I did good at the end. You know, it'll be like the opposite of the how-i-did-good posts. Maybe this way I can fix whatever bad habits I have. It will also show me how long it takes till I kick my bad habits to the curb."

For real, I have been taking way to long to find a good use for my blog. I speculate that this is mainly because I want to record, and show, whatever good I have done for the world around me. Then something hit me today, as I realized I do way, way, way, almost zero good. (For my position). I added the parenthesis there because I'd like to think that I'm not that waste of a human life after all. Anyways, I figured that I should stop being such a loser and such a kid and do something productive. I mean, as a Ph.D. student, right now I feel wholly, awfully unqualified to do anything. Maybe I'm in a (major) slump. Or maybe this is who I am. Anyways, as a guy about to hit 30, I figured I need to get my sh*t together and get over whatever I need to get over.

BYAH.

So. This is what this blog will cover from now on. I will post an evaluation of mostly my failures and an occasional success before bed, either every or every other day (ha, see what I did there). I will revel in how bad at life I am at at the end of each day, and we can all laugh about it. Hopefully, I can find patterns in what I suck at and can try to improve in those areas. Hopefully, after some time those same mistakes or "categories" won't appear anymore. *Hopefully*. 

Well, I know it's late but here's to 2019. If anybody's curious, these are what I want to achieve by the end of the year, personal and professional goals alike:

-[ ] Submit, and subsequently get published on two separate research papers; one in the spring, the other in the fall  
-[ ] Get my graduation path ready  
-[ ] Evaluate myself based on the HCI group recommendation guidelines, and score a solid 4 across the board.  
-[ ] Fix my "apathy" as noted by my advisor ðŸ¤”  
-[ ] Shave 10kg's off my fat body  
-[ ] Get selected for Team Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·  
-[ ] Win club nationals
